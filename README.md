# Quiet Music, Weak Sounds

![qmws](qmws.jpg?raw=true "qmws")

## Overview

Kyoto-based researcher and sound artist Eisuke Yanagisawa and I will collaboratively research the unheard, subtle, and weak sounds of Kyotoâ€™s
soundscape. 

Our explorations will develop into new tools and techniques for sound artist to use for exploring their sonic environment. 

Hosted through a micro-residency at Social Kitchen, we will facilitate workshops within the community on building and using these tools, documenting our findings through bilingual instruction for reproducing our tools and techniques, interactive installations, performances and presentations.

Over the course of four weeks, we will:

- Conduct fieldwork and record "weak" sounds using various different microphones and recording techniques in and around Kyoto

- Develop new tools and prepare workshops hosted at Social Kitchen

- Host a series of workshops, still to be determined

- Present our findings in the form of a talk/exhibition/reception/party! :tada:
